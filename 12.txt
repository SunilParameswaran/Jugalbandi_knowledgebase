Let’s learn how to identify failure as the stepping stone of success Failure means lack of success in a goal or a task. When you set a goal, but cannot achieve it, it is a failure.
If something is not accepted by someone it is called rejection.
We all experience failure and rejection many times in our life. To be more successful in the future, we need to learn to handle failure and rejection with a positive attitude.
Failure and rejection can make us sad or frustrated. But in reality, they are the best opportunity for us to learn something new. By learning from failure, we can discover our weaknesses and work on our strengths.
Nila has been preparing for an interview for 1 week. She was very sure that she would get the job. On the day of the interview she got nervous. She was not able to answer some questions and got rejected. What should Nila do? Tick the right answer:
Keep thinking about her failure

Practice riding properly and take the test again
Let’s learn about how to handle rejection and failure in a positive manner
Thomas Alva Edison failed 10,000 times before inventing a proper electric bulb. When he was asked how he did it even after so many failures, he replied “I have not failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that do not work”.
Another example is of Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. He was the Project Manager for India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle. The first attempt was a failure because the rocket crashed into the sea. He did not stop working on it. Exactly one year later, the launch was successful in the second attempt.
From the above two examples, we can easily understand:

It is common to fail or get rejected
We all need to learn how to handle failure and rejection positively
When handle failure and rejection positively, our chances to success are more
Failure or rejection does not mean we cannot try again.
How can you learn from failure and achieve success?
1. Think about it: Note down all the steps you took. Find out what you could have done differently
2. Stay focused: Do not lose focus from your goals
3. Take a break: Take a small break to think about your next steps

Let’s learn about platform-based jobs
Because of the Internet, we don’t always have to find a company to hire us. Platform-based jobs are a great way to create self employment. Platform-based jobs can help us earn well too!
Platform-based jobs are jobs that you find by being part of a particular online platform or an app. For e.g, drivers can find many customers by using the Ola or Uber app in big cities.
Different types of work opportunities and jobs can be found through such websites and apps. Platform- based jobs connect workers in two main ways:
1. Worker to Customer
2. Worker to Company
1. Worker to Customer: Jobs for plumbers, electricians, delivery people can be found through apps such
as Urban Company, Helpr, Dunzo, Swiggy etc
2. Worker to Company: Some apps help you find work with the companies directly. These jobs include
writing, editing, designing etc.
If you sign up to do platform-based jobs, you get the choice and flexibility to choose how often you will work. How many hours a week would you work? What timings would you choose?

I would like to work as a in a platform-based job.

I would like to work hours per week.

I would like to work from a.m/p.m to a.m/p.m.

Companies share a job description which helps you understand if you are a good fit for the job. It has details of the role, job location, qualifications required to help you apply for the job. This way, job search engines make it much easier for us to find work that fits our training and skills.
Here are some popular job portals in India:
Portals like Naukri and Indeed have all kinds of jobs. Specialized portals are designed to find jobs in very specific categories.
For example,

Freshersworld is a portal specifically for freshers - people who have just finished studying.

Jobs For Her is a portal specifically for women to find jobs.

Let’s learn to find job roles available for technicians
When looking for technical/ trade related job roles, it may sometimes be difficult to find jobs online through job portals. In such cases one can take a different approach as well. You can follow the below steps to search for trade specific jobs:
1. Make a list of companies.
Search for companies you would like to work for. You can make this list based on your skills and a market scan/ talking to people in the similar field.
2. Search using relevant job titles.
Using the correct words to search for a job is very important. Companies have different titles for the same job role. You can use key skills to look for jobs too. For example, using the word ‘computer technician’ will give you better results than using the word ‘technician’
3. Search in the correct portals.
You can search on job portals like Naukri.com or the company website of the company you’re interested in. Find the ‘Careers’ page on their website and search for jobs.
4. Use various filters.
When looking for jobs on the internet, you can set filters as per your years of experience, technical skills, preferred location.
5. Contact companies directly
If you are unable to find a careers page or job listings online, look for an email id or contact number online and reach out over mail with your resume or call on the listed number and ask if they are hiring for positions you are interested in.
Write a list of 2 or 3 people who are working in your field. They can be alumni or friends and family.
